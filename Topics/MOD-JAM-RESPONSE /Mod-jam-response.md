work immediately stands out with its vibrant colors and strong aesthetic appeal. The scale of the piece gives a sense of immersion, allowing viewers to feel surrounded by the art rather than simply observing it. It feels deeply personal being one of the most authentic self-portraits I’ve seen with it capturing her likeness and spirit beautifully. The inclusion of a mask adds emotional depth, symbolizing themes of identity and concealment. The color palette blends well, creating a balanced and thoughtful composition. Beyond the visual aspects, her code demonstrates a clear understanding of structure and organization. The use of variables creates a clean setup, while her well-written comments show an awareness of clarity and communication within her creative coding process. Overall, her work successfully merges artistic expression and technical execution.

Ben’s project stands out for its interactivity and simplicity. It begins as a blank black screen, but when the user hovers over the canvas, the cursor transforms into a colorful animation, revealing a flower that appears to bloom on contact. This interactive effect is both engaging and imaginative, giving life to the canvas through motion and color. It demonstrates how digital art can invite participation rather than passive viewing. The coding approach is clean and purposeful, using variables effectively and keeping the draw functions concise. Ben’s art jam explores the idea of creation through interaction, showing how even minimal coding elements can produce a visually and nice conceptually experience.

Blaise’s Art Jam: https://blaise2004.github.io/cart253/topics/ArtJam/template-p5-project/Blaise’s piece was perhaps the most visually striking and conceptually layered. I appreciated the thoughtful use of color, shape, and layering, which revealed a deep understanding of composition and design. The integration of animation, such as the dynamic clouds and the changing sky that responds to mouse movements. brings the piece to life. Allowing the frame’s movement to adjust with the mouse position creates a fluid, responsive experience that emphasizes user interaction. Blaise’s code is detailed and strategic, utilizing variables and multiple shapes to build complexity while maintaining coherence. This art jam beautifully combines creativity, technical skill, and interactivity, making it one of the strongest examples of digital artistry in motion with reviewing his code I can tell it took him a lot of work and effort to create, over 800 lines of code takes a lot of attention to detail and patience to execute.

Felix Mod Jam: https://gargamelleuwu.github.io/CART253/Mod%20Jam/template-p5-project/

I really enjoyed playing Felix Fly Frog - it was a smooth and engaging experience overall. The instructions and goals displayed on the start screen were clear and informative, setting up the gameplay nicely. I especially liked the "Select" option at the beginning, where players can customize their frog by choosing different body and tongue colors.The background music felt fun and calming, enhancing the overall mood of the game. The visuals were cohesive and worked beautifully together. I also appreciated the concept of the hunger bar - it's a clever mechanic that makes the frog slower and less efficient at catching flies as it gets hungrier, adding an interesting challenge.

Additionally, the inclusion of a miss counter was a smart UX choice, as it keeps players attentive and adds a layer of excitement during gameplay. Overall, Felix Fly Frog delivers a delightful and well-designed gaming experience. I can tell he put a lot of time and effort into his work wich payed off.

I really enjoyed playing Ben's Battle of the Croaks game. The title screen is big and inviting, immediately drawing me in. Having the title "Battle of the Croaks" displayed in bright orange gives it a strong, bold presence, and the flickering "Play" button adds a nostalgic touch that reminds me of classic online games I used to play. The layered background design also looks very cool and gives the scene a sense of depth.

When the game begins, you're greeted by a vibrant fly that stands out beautifully against the background. I really liked the idea of having two "croaks" on screen,the player's frog competing to eat as many flies as possible while avoiding misses that feed the Hypno Toad. The glowing eyes of the Hypno Toad are especially striking, and the way its body grows larger as it collects more flies adds a fun visual cue and sense of tension.

The end screen also works really well, it provides a satisfying sense of closure and i really enjoy the font choice. Overall, I found Battle of the Croaks to be creative, visually engaging, and thoughtfully designed from start to finish.

I really enjoyed playing Norah's Mod Jam game. The overall screen design feels like it's emulating an old-school handheld game, which gives it a fun, nostalgic vibe. The title screen and choice of fonts look intentional and well executed, setting the tone right from the start.

The game begins when you click anywhere on the screen, transitioning to a scene where a frog sits on a hill trying to catch flies. The goal is to catch as many flies as possible before the bar on the left side runs out - it acts as a timer. I liked how every click, even when you miss, triggers a sound effect; it keeps the experience interactive and lively. When you successfully catch flies, your own progress bar fills up, and if you manage to fill it before time runs out, you win.

The overall experience reminded me of games I used to play when I was younger - it brought back a sense of nostalgia and simplicity that made the game especially enjoyable.
